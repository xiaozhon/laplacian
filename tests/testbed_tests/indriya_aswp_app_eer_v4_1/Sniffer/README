* This Sniffer application comes from the Z-Monitor:

	http://www.z-monitor.org/index.php?title=Main_Page 

  with very tiny modifications. 

* The directory contains:
	1. the Sniffer application that can be used on Telosb motes or Micaz motes.
	2. a simple packet parser (based on C language)that can parse sniffered packets. Current it
	   supports parsing acknowledgement packet, CTP data packet, routing packets, and 
	   MobileDeluge packets.
	   
	   
* Usage:
	
	1. Install c serial forwarder:
	  > goto tinyos-2.1.2/support/sdk/c/sf and run following commands:
	      ./bootstrap
	      ./configure
	      make
	    this will build the "libmote.a" file that needed by the PacketParser.
	    
	2. Install the sniffer application to a telosb/micaz mote.
	     make telosb install,[id] bsl,/dev/ttyUSB# 			or
	     make micaz installl,[id] mib520,/dev/ttyUSB#
	  The [id] can be any number.
	  
	  > Change the value of
	  		CFLAGS += -DSNIFFER_CHANNEL=26
	  	in makefile to compile Sniffer for different radio channel. the channel ranges in [11, 26]
	  	
	3. Run PacketParser:
	     In the Sniffer folder, run
	     	./PacketParser
