SimpleDrip:

A simple replacement of Drip. It keeps the same set of interfaces to the higher layer
as Drip does. The functionalities are largely simplified: it only disseminates packets
in one-hop range. It is designed as the lower layer for MobileDeluge.

Functionalities:

1. Disseminate packets from base station to nodes.

2. Base will send the new packet in a constant rate of 1 packet/5 seconds. It does not 
   follow the trickle pattern.
   
3. Nodes will only receive this packet and signal the higher layer, it will not rebroadcast
   this packets.
