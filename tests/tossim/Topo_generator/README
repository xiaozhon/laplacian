# topology files with different size/density. The base line is the "grid_225nodes_2.3m.txt"
The density is 225 nodes in "32.2m*32.2m" space.

1. keep density, node size from 100 to 500.

   for 100 nodes:
   	 23m * 23m
   for 200 nodes:
     area = 200 / (255/(32.2*32.2))
     dimension = sqrt(area)
